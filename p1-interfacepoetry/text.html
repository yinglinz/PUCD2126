  [Verse 1: Elohim]
  There's no one else here around me
  Sinking my feet in the sand
  I'll be right here on this island
  I hope that you understand



  [Pre-Chorus: Elohim]
  Ooooo ya
  I'm feeling it I'm feeling it
  Oooooya
  Come to me quick come to me quick



  [Chorus: Elohim]
  I just wanna go where love is alive
  Love is alive love is alive

  Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
  Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
  Oh I just wanna go where love is alive
  So I'm gonna do that


  [Refrain: Elohim]
  I just wanna go where love is alive
  I just wanna go where love is alive



  [Verse 2: Elohim]
  All of the chaos surrenders
  Changing the currents and tide
  The water can keep getting deeper
  Cause I'll be right here staying dry

  [Pre-Chorus: Elohim]
  Ooooo ya
  I'm feeling it I'm feeling it
  Oooooya
  Come to me quick come to me quick



  [Chorus: Elohim]
  I just wanna go where love is alive, love is alive, love is alive
  I just wanna go where love is alive, love is alive, love is alive


  Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
  Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
  Oh I just wanna go where love is alive
  So I'm gonna do that

  I just wanna go where love is alive
  So I'm gonna do that
  I just wanna go where love is alive, love is alive, love is alive
  I just wanna go where love is alive, love is alive, love is alive

  Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
  Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
  Oh I just wanna go where love is alive
  So I'm gonna do that



  [Refrain: Elohim]
  I just wanna go where love is alive
  I just wanna go where love is alive
  So I'm gonna do that



  [Pre-Chorus: Elohim]
  Ooh yeah
  I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it
  Ooh yeah
  Come to me quick, come to me quick
  Ooh yeah
  I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it
  Ooh yeah
  Come to me quick, come to me quick



  [Chorus: Elohim]
  I just wanna go where love is alive, love is alive, love is alive
  I just wanna go where love is alive, love is alive, love is alive
  Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
  Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
  Oh I just wanna go where love is alive
  So I'm gonna do that
